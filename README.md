- 👋 Hi, I’m @ariepaulus
- 👀 I’m interested in website development - I am retired and freelancing as a language editor and proofreader; and need to market my services to earn some extra money to add to my pension.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Joomla 4 and have set up a localhost configuration to get up to speed before going live.
- 💞️ I have some spare time when my editing services are not needed and wouldn't mind assisting in a project if I could be useful in some capacity linked to my background and skills (mainly public health services management).
- 📫 How to reach me: averburgh@gmail.com
